## [Unreleased]

### Changed

### Added

- WEMI part: Item
- `notes` property to `Entity`
- DB: `split_label` column to `identifiables`
- search by label, optionally limited to the language
  - looks for the existence of the single words in arbitrary order by default (optimized and thus to be preferred)
  - to search for a phrase embed the term in double quotes (can be much slower)

- Added missing `lastModified` column to the list of `IdentifierType`, `RenderingTemplate` and `User`
- Added rendering of the list of `License` and `Work` and of a single `License`

### Changed

- find by `searchTerm` looks for the existence of the single words;
  to look for the words as phrase, embed them in double quotes (but it will be much slower)

- **Breaking**: Bumped `dc-model` dependency to version `11.0.0`

### Fixed

- Fixed copy&paste of `iframe`, `image` and `video` blocks in the editor
